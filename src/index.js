// Importing JavaScript
//
// You have two choices for including Bootstrap's JS filesâ€”the whole thing,
// or just the bits that you need.


// Option 1
//
// Import Bootstrap's complete JavaScript bundle and Popper.js dependency

// import * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap';


// Option 2
//
// Import only the plugins we need

import { Dropdown as Dropdown, Offcanvas as Offcanvas } from 'bootstrap';
